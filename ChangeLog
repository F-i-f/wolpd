	options in alphabetical order.
	(g_promiscuous): Create.
	(usage_and_exit, parse_options): Add -P/--promiscuous.
	(set_promiscuous): Create.
	(main): Set promiscuous mode if requested.

	(parse_options): Handle the -p option.
	(WOL_MIN_UDP_SIZE): Define the minimum UDP WOL packet size,
	including UDP header.
	(WOL_MAGIC_LEN): Use ETH_ALEN instead.
	(DEFAULT_IFACE): Remove.
	(g_iface): Renamed to g_output_iface, don't provide a default.
	(g_input_iface): Created.
	(get_if_index): Factorized the code to get interface index.
	(setup_filter): Created, set-up a BPF filter.
	(main): Full overhaul:

	  o Use a BPF filter with full WOL packet validation.
	  o Re-validate the packet after receiving it in userspace.
	  o Simplified re-sending code path, send the full link-layer packet.
	Replace perror() with fprintf() for more detailed messages.
