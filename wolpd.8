.SH NAME
wolpd \- Wake-On-LAN proxy daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wolpd
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Wake-on-LAN (WOL) is an Ethernet computer networking standard that
allows a computer to be turned on or woken up by a network
message. The message is usually sent by a simple program executed on
another computer on the local area network.

WOL packets are not forwarded by routers, which is where
.B wolpd
comes into play, by proxying WOL packets from one network to an other.

WOL packets can be send either over UDP transport or in a raw Ethernet frame.
.B wolpd
can listen to one or both kinds on an
.I input interface
and forward them to an
.I output interface
which must be specified respectively with
.B \-\-input\-interface
and
.B \-\-output\-interface
options.

By default,
.B wolpd
only listens for Ethernet frames with Ethertype
.I 0x0842
which is the standard Ethertype for raw WOL packets.  The Ethertype
can be changed with the
.B \-\-ethertype
option.  Listening for raw Ethernet frames can also be disabled with
the
.B \-\-no\-ether
option.

.B wolpd
can also listen for UDP-encapsulated WOL packets if the
.B \-\-udp
or
.B \-\-port
options are used.  Just using
.B \-\-udp
will turn on listening to UDP packets on
.BI any
UDP port.  Using the
.B \-\-port
option (with or without the
.B \-\-udp
option) will turn on UDP listening only on the given UDP port.

.SH "PROMISCUOUS MODE"
The
.B \-\-promiscuous
option sets the input interface specified with
.B \-\-input\-interface
in promiscuous mode.  This is only necessary:
.RS 4
.IP \(bu 3
when listening for raw Ethernet WOL frames, if unicast WOL
packets are used.
.IP \(bu
when listening for UDP WOL packets, if the machine running
.B wolpd
is not the default router on the network.
.RE

If the WOL packets don't get forwarded by \fBwolpd\fR, you may want to
try the
.B \-\-promiscuous
option.
.SH SECURITY
For best security, run wolpd with both
.B \-\-chroot
and
.B \-\-setuid
options.
.br
Create an empty directory (eg. /var/empty/wolpd), owned by root.
.br
Create a dedicated wolpd user and group.
.br
Then run wolpd with:
.PP
.RS 2
\fBwolpd\fR \fB\-\-chroot\fR /var/empty/wolpd \fB\-\-setuid\fR wolpd \fI[other-options]\fR
.RE
.PP
.B wolpd
logs every packet it forwards to
.BR syslog(3)
(or to standard error instead if running in the \fB\-\-foreground\fR)
and the messages look like:
.PP
.RS 4
.Bd -unfilled
\f[CW]wolpd[\fIpid\f(CW]: magic raw Ethernet packet from
\fIXX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\f(CW to \fIYY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY\f(CW WOL
\fIZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ\f(CW
.PP
\f[CW]wolpd[\fIpid\f(CW]: magic UDP packet from
\fIXX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\f(CW/\fIxx.xx.xx.xx\f(CW port \fIsport\f(CW to
\fIYY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY\f(CW/\fIyy.yy.yy.yy\f(CW port \fIdport\f(CW WOL
\fIZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ\f(CW
.PP
.Be
.ft R
.RS -2
where:
.PP
.RS 3
.IP \(bu 3
\fIXX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX\fR is the source Ethernet address of the
received WOL frame,
.IP \(bu
\fIYY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY\fR is the destination Ethernet address of the
received WOL frame,
.IP \(bu
\fIxx.xx.xx.xx\fR and \fIsport\fR are the source IP address and UDP
port of the received WOL frame,
.IP \(bu
\fIyy.yy.yy.yy\fR and \fIdport\fR are the destination IP address and
UDP port of the received WOL frame,
.IP \(bu
\fIZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ:ZZ\fR is Ethernet address of the host to be awoken
(the WOL payload field).
.RS -5
.PP
Errors are also logged to
.BR syslog(3)
(or to standard error instead if running in the
.B \-\-foreground
).
.SH PERFORMANCE
.B wolpd
uses socket filters (BPF) on its input raw socket(s) to inspect the
frames and validates the full WOL payload.  Only valid WOL frames
are returned to user-space, and the invalid ones are discarded in the
kernel.
.PP
However note that using the
.B \-\-promiscuous
option may negatively affect networking performance.

You do not need
.B wolpd
to send WOL packets from host2 to host3 since they are on the same
network.  But
.B wolpd
is needed if you want to sent WOL packets from host1 to host3:
.RS 2
.PP
\fBwolpd \-\-input\-interface\fR enp1 \fB\-\-output\-interface\fR enp2
.RS 2
.PP
will forward broadcast raw Ethernet WOL frames with the standard WOL
Ethertype of
.I 0x0842
from enp1 to enp2.  You can then WOL host3 from host1 by running on
host1:

.RS 2
.B  ether-wake \-b

.RS -2
Note that
.B \-b
is required when invoking ether-wake since

is not running in promiscuous mode.

\fBwolpd \-\-input\-interface\fR enp1 \fB\-\-output\-interface\fR enp2 \
